In this project we explore the current level of transit accessibility at the block group level in Seattle. Our main question is which areas currently have the most, and least access to transit in King county. We follow this up with an analysis of who is most affected in areas with low transit coverage, and potentially allow the viewer to interactively place transit stops or change service parameters to view the effects on accessibility. To accomplish this we first quantify accessibility based on the KCM GTFS transit stop locations and schedules, and create a choropleth map as our main visualization.

## Public transit provides a valuable resource to communities it reaches, allowing them to access jobs, stores, neighborhoods, schools and more. However, the transit network is limited by its infrastructure and other resources. In the current system, what locations in Seattle are most accessible by transit, who is affected, and how might the network best be improved?

To answer this, we utilize several datasets related to transit availability and the socioeconomics of the Seattle region. The fundamental transit schedule and stop location data is drawn from the King County Metro (KCM) [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](http://metro.kingcounty.gov/gtfs/). This resource provides a static list of all available stops, routes, and schedules in the KCM network. To create the choropleth maps, block group shapefiles are taken from the American Community Survey (ACS) [TIGER shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html). These designate areas at which socioeconomic census data is available for. The ACS also provides socioeconomic data in the form of marginal counts for each block group, as well as a set of limited microdata called the [public use microdata samples (PUMS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html).

We can see that the majority of King County is made up of white residents at about 2/3 of the population. The Asian population in King County
has the second most residents with just 18%, and no other race comprises of more than 6% of the King County population.
[br /][br /][br /][br /][br /]

The number of accessible stops per block group in King County is approximately normally distributed, with the majority of block groups
having somewhere between 70 and 100 accessible stops. There are some outliers with close to 200 accessible stops, which are likely block
groups located near downtown Seattle.
[br /][br /][br /][br /][br /]

The distribution of the total number of stops per block group has a clear right skew, with most block groups having less than 
50 stops.

    This `Scroller` uses some custom CSS to set the background color to "#33333f" [Inline][div style:`{background: "#33333f", width: 12, height: 12}` /][/Inline].
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    It also uses custom CSS to style the `Graphic` (which is a custom D3 component) so that it appears as a fixed visualization next to the scrolling text.
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    What's cool about this `CustomD3Component` is that it updates as we scroll. It does this by leveraging the `update` function to animate the point as it moves to a new position.
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    To keep track of where we are in the `Scroller`, we first defined a dynamic Idyll variable named `myLocation` using the following code: `[var name:"myLocation" value:0 /]`
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    Each time we scroll to a new `Step`, the `Graphic` updates it state based on this dynamic variable, which can be used to parameterize the visualization.
  [/Step]

  [Step]
    Right now, the value of `myLocation` is [Display value:myLocation /]. Cool huh?

    [span style:`{color:'#aaa', fontStyle:'italic'}`]If you scroll back and forth between this `Step` and the previous one, notice how the value that is displayed changes based on when the new `Step` is triggered.[/span]
